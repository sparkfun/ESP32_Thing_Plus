The [SparkFun ESP32 Thing Plus](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15663) is a comprehensive development platform for [Espressif's ESP32](https://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview).

Add to that a rich set of peripherals ranging from capacitive touch sensors, Hall sensors, SD card interface, Ethernet, high-speed SPI, UART, I2S and I<sup>2</sup>C.

Upgraded and easy to use, the Esp32 Thing Plus will help make it the foundation of IoT and connected projects for many years to come.
